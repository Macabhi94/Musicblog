            <p>Title: My Favorite Music Genre
Origins (1960s)

Baker, Bruce and Clapton of Cream, whose blues rock improvisation was a major factor in the development of the genre
In the 1960s, American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming, and louder vocals, from electric blues.[11] Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin&#39; Wolf,[16] the Kingsmen&#39;s version of &#34;Louie Louie&#34; (1963) which made it a garage rock standard,[17] and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts,[18] including &#34;You Really Got Me&#34; by the Kinks (1964),[19] &#34;My Generation&#34; by the Who (1965)[5] and &#34;(I Can&#39;t Get No) Satisfaction&#34; (1965) by the Rolling Stones.[20] Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.[21] In contrast, hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity.[5]

Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the Jeff Beck Group.[5] Cream, in songs like &#34;I Feel Free&#34; (1966), combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton.[22] Cream&#39;s best known-song, &#34;Sunshine of Your Love&#34; (1967), is sometimes considered to be the culmination of the British adaptation of blues into rock and a direct precursor of Led Zeppelin&#39;s style of hard rock and heavy metal.[23] Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll.[24] From 1967, Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group.[25] Dave Davies of the Kinks, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of the Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion.[26] The Doors&#39; debut album, released in 1967, included songs like &#34;Soul Kitchen&#34;, &#34;Twentieth Century Fox&#34;, and a cover version of &#34;Back Door Man&#34;, which were what music journalist Stephen Davis characterized as &#34;enough hard rock tracks&#34;.[27] One track that stands out as especially heavy for its time is the last 1:10 of &#34;I Feel Much Better&#34; by the Small Faces, recorded in May 1967. The first 2:46 is typical psychedelic fare of the time, but then the song suddenly changes into a hard bass-and-guitar power chord with Steve Marriott&#39;s rhythm guitar and gut bucket singing, equal to the heaviest rock to be heard later. The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the &#34;White Album&#34;) and, with the track &#34;Helter Skelter&#34;, attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who.[28] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has referred to the &#34;proto-metal roar&#34; of &#34;Helter Skelter&#34;,[29] while Ian MacDonald called it &#34;ridiculous, with McCartney shrieking weedily against a massively tape-echoed backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing&#34;.[28]

Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly, MC5, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.[30] San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran&#39;s classic &#34;Summertime Blues&#34;, from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound.[30] The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including &#34;Born to Be Wild&#34;, which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider (1969).[30] Iron Butterfly&#39;s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.[30]

By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin (1969) and Led Zeppelin II (1969), and Deep Purple, who began as a progressive rock group in 1968 but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, Deep Purple in Rock (1970). Also significant was Black Sabbath&#39;s Paranoid (1970), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror.[31] All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath&#39;s lead into territory that was often &#34;darker and more menacing&#34;, hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.[5]</p>
